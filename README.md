# Rethinking the Optimization Objective for Transferable Adversarial Examples from a Fuzzy Perspective (Accpeted by Neural Networks 2024)

This repository is the official Pytorch code implementation for our paper "Rethinking the Optimization Objective for Transferable Adversarial Examples from a Fuzzy Perspective". In this paper, we propose a fuzzy optimization-based transferable attack (FOTA) to maximize both the original cross-entropy loss and the newly proposed membership functions. The proposed membership functions are positively correlated to the transferability of adversarial examples.
